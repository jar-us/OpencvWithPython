- OpenCV provides imread and imwrite functions to read and write image.
- OpenCV supports various image file formats like BMP, PNG, JPEG, TIFF for reading and writing images.
- Images are represented as multidimensional arrays, with grayscale images as 2D arrays and color images as 3D arrays.
- Pixel values are stored as integers, with grayscale pixels ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white), and color pixels having separate values for each channel (e.g., BGR).
- The shape property of a NumPy array provides information about the image's dimensions and number of channels.
- OpenCV's imread function can load images with various options like grayscale, color, original bit depth, and reduced resolution.
- The imwrite function requires the image to be in the correct format (BGR or grayscale) and bit depth supported by the output file format.
